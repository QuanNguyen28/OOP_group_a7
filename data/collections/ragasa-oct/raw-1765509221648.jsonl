Canada Post is denying that the federal government's directive to modernize its operations gives it leverage over the striking union, despite the Canadian Union of Postal Workers calling a nationwide strike in response to the reforms. The government has ordered Canada Post to end home delivery and close some rural outlets as part of a plan to stabilize finances for the Crown corporation, which is on track to lose $1.5 billion in 2025. The union claims the government is taking orders from Canada Post management, while small town leaders express concern about potential post office closures disrupting their communities.\n\n[Edmonton MP Heather McPherson enters NDP leadership race](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/edmonton-mp-heather-mcpherson-enters-ndp-leadership-race-1.7645303). Edmonton-Strathcona MP Heather McPherson has entered the NDP leadership race, becoming the second major candidate and the only one currently holding a House of Commons seat. McPherson focused her campaign launch on inclusion and bringing people together, emphasizing the need for the party to change how it communicates rather than what it believes. Former Alberta premier Rachel Notley endorsed McPherson, praising her ability to work through difficult situations and unite divided groups, while McPherson warned that an election could come as early as spring.\n\n[Business leaders call for tax relief, access to capital in upcoming federal budget](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sunday-business-feature-1.7645869). Canadian business leaders are calling for tax relief, improved access to capital, and reduced regulatory burdens in the upcoming federal budget scheduled for November 4. Industry groups want measures that encourage private sector investment and address the impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly the elimination of the de minimis exemption that hurt small businesses. The tech sector is seeking reforms to the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax incentive program, while mining associations are pushing for increased capital funding and stronger Indigenous participation in the industry.\n\n[Canada's attempt to deport Iranian regime members fails again](https://globalnews.ca/news/11454043/canadas-deport-iranian-regime-officials-afshin-pirnoon/). Canada's efforts to deport Iranian regime officials have suffered another setback, with the Immigration and Refugee Board declining to approve the deportation of Afshin Pirnoon, a former roads ministry director. This marks the fourth failed deportation case under a 2022 program designed to prevent senior Iranian officials from resettling in Canada, with only one official successfully removed in nearly three years. The IRB ruled that despite Pirnoon's 22-year government career and participation in political ceremonies with Revolutionary Guard members, he did not qualify as a \"senior official\" with significant influence on government power.\n\n\n\n**United States:**\n\n[3 things to know about Trump's plan to send troops to Portland and Memphis](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5556831/portland-memphis-national-guard-trump-troops). President Trump ordered the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland for 60 days to protect ICE facilities, claiming the city is \"war ravaged\" despite officials and crime statistics indicating otherwise. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson dispute Trump's characterization and filed a federal lawsuit arguing the deployment is unlawful, with Oregon claiming it violated the 10th Amendment. This deployment follows similar actions in D.C., Los Angeles, and Memphis, with legal experts expressing concern about the normalization of troops on U.S. streets and the challenges to centuries-old laws limiting the military's domestic role.\n\n[Oregon sues Trump administration over deployment of National Guard troops to Portland](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/oregon-sues-trump-administration-deployment-national-guard-troops-port-rcna234307). Oregon and Portland filed a lawsuit naming President Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the Department of Homeland Security as defendants to stop the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland. The suit claims the federal government lacks grounds to call in the guard, citing only \"small\" protests near an ICE facility, while Portland crime statistics show crime levels on par with last year with a 50% drop in homicides. The plaintiffs argue the administration violated the 10th Amendment's police powers reserved to states, comparing it to a California case where a federal judge ruled the administration illegally deployed troops in violation of the 19th century Posse Comitatus Act.\n\n[Attack at a Mormon church in Michigan leaves at least 4 dead, 8 injured](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/28/nx-s1-5555970/multiple-people-shot-mormon-church-michigan-shooter-down). At least four people were killed and eight injured when Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, rammed his vehicle through the front doors of a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township and opened fire with an assault rifle before deliberately setting the church on fire. Two officers responded in less than a minute and neutralized the suspect in the parking lot, with investigators believing he used gasoline as an accelerant and finding suspected explosive devices. President Trump called it \"yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States,\" while authorities said more victims remain unaccounted for in the burned-out church, with no motive yet provided for the attack.\n\n[Church of Latter Day Saints responds to Michigan shooting](https://www.newsweek.com/church-of-latter-day-saints-responds-to-michigan-shooting-10795664). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a statement condemning the \"tragic act of violence\" and calling places of worship \"sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection.\" Suspect Thomas Jacob Sanford was a veteran with an Iraq license plate on his truck, whose only prior legal issue was a rent dispute in Utah, and he was killed during a shootout with police as he attempted to flee. The attack adds to a disturbing pattern of violence targeting religious communities in the U.S., with the FBI leading the federal investigation while providing support to state and local officials.\n\n[Trump says he'll attend Pete Hegseth's gathering of generals to tell them 'how well we're doing militarily'](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-pete-hegseth-generals-military-meeting-rcna234216). President Trump confirmed he will attend Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's unusual meeting gathering hundreds of senior military officers at Quantico Marine Corps Base on Tuesday, describing it as an \"esprit de corps\" meeting about military accomplishments. Senior admirals and generals stationed worldwide were summoned without being informed beforehand about the meeting's purpose, which one official said is to highlight military accomplishments and discuss the future of the Defense Department. The meeting comes as Hegseth recently rebranded the Department of Defense as the \"Department of War\" and ordered staffing cuts among high-ranking military officials, ahead of a potential government shutdown next week.\n\n[Top congressional leaders head to the White House ahead of shutdown deadline](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/g-s1-90959/congress-leaders-white-house-shutdown). The top four congressional leaders are meeting with President Trump on Monday afternoon, just ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and avoid a shutdown. The House passed a continuing resolution through Nov. 21 that failed in the Senate due to Democratic opposition, with Democrats demanding permanent expanded Affordable Care Act tax cuts that expire at year-end and repeal of GOP health care cuts. The White House budget office instructed federal agencies to prepare for permanent layoffs instead of temporary furloughs, which Democrats called \"mafia-style blackmail,\" while Republicans insist on passing a clean stopgap bill first before negotiating on health care subsidies.\n\n[Schumer says 'we need a serious negotiation' with the GOP to keep government open](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schumer-negotiation-gop-trump-government-funding-shutdown-rcna233895). Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said preventing a government shutdown depends on Republicans engaging in a \"serious negotiation,\" emphasizing he helped avoid shutdowns as majority leader by negotiating rather than putting together partisan bills. Schumer called the White House meeting a \"first step\" but expressed concern that if Trump \"rants and just yells at Democrats,\" nothing will be accomplished. Democrats are pushing for extensions of expiring Obamacare funds and reversal of Republican health care cuts, while Schumer dismissed the White House memo threatening mass firings as an intimidation tactic, noting \"they're doing it anyway\" even without a shutdown.\n\n[Sen. John Thune digs in on GOP funding bill, accusing Democrats of holding government 'hostage'](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/thune-gop-funding-bill-democrats-holding-government-host-rcna233878). Senate Majority Leader John Thune vowed Republicans will hold firm on their seven-week funding bill, insisting it's \"totally up to the Democrats\" to prevent a shutdown and accusing them of taking the federal government \"hostage\" to pursue ideological demands. Thune said he's open to discussing Obamacare fund extensions that expire at year-end, but only with new limitations on who can access those tax credits and not as part of the government funding bill due Tuesday. He defended the Justice Department's indictment of former FBI Director James Comey and sidestepped questions about whether the DOJ should follow Trump's wishes to prosecute other political adversaries, saying the courts will decide and that administrations always assert as much authority as they can.\n\n[Suspect held after allegedly firing from boat into waterfront bar in North Carolina](https://www.npr.org/2025/09/28/nx-s1-5556033/north-carolina-shooting-southport-american-fish-company). Three people were killed and five wounded in Southport, North Carolina, when Nigel Edge allegedly drove his boat alongside the American Fish Company bar and opened fire with an assault rifle in what police called a premeditated attack. Edge, 41, fled the scene by boat toward the Intracoastal Waterway before being apprehended at a public boat ramp by the Coast Guard half an hour later, with many victims being tourists rather than local residents. The suspect, who changed his name from Sean Debevoise and is a decorated Purple Heart combat veteran who served in Iraq, is being held without bond and is expected to appear in court Monday, with the bar closed indefinitely.\n\n[Pentagon Asks to Quadruple Missile Production: Report](https://www.newsweek.com/pentagon-missiles-production-china-war-us-10796646). The Pentagon has told missile suppliers that production needs to quadruple, according to The Wall Street Journal, with top Pentagon officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman General Dan Caine meeting with manufacturers in June. More than three years of war in Ukraine, the Israel-Iran conflict, and surging demand for long-range weapons and air defense interceptors have depleted missile stockpiles, causing growing anxiety about a possible future conflict with China. There are pressing concerns about using expensive missiles to shoot down cheap disposable drones, with NATO governments emphasizing the need for closer links between governments, armed forces, and industry to reach ambitious new weapons production targets.\n\n[Millions of Americans Face Imminent Flood Insurance Lapse](https://www.newsweek.com/americans-flood-insurance-lapse-10795860). The National Flood Insurance Program providing $1.3 trillion in flood coverage to 4.7 million policyholders is set to expire September 30 unless Congress extends it, potentially preventing homeowners from getting coverage during intensifying disaster season. The program, backed by taxpayers and offering up to $250,000 for homes and $500,000 for nonresidential buildings, has a debt of over $22.5 billion and its borrowing capacity would be slashed from $30.425 billion to $1 billion if it lapses. New policies won't be issued, renewals won't be processed, and real estate transactions in flood plains will freeze, with the Insurance Fairness Project warning that federal cuts to FEMA and NOAA have already threatened insurance availability and a lapse would worsen the climate-driven insurance crisis.\n\n[Trump says he 'would think' DOJ is investigating former FBI Director Christopher Wray](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-weighs-whether-doj-investigate-former-fbi-director-christopher-w-rcna234225). President Trump accused former FBI Director Christopher Wray of \"inappropriate\" behavior and said he \"would think\" the Justice Department is investigating him, making unfounded claims about 274 FBI agents being \"secretly placed\" in crowds on January 6th. Trump also discussed plans to potentially send troops to Portland and promised federal operations in Chicago, while addressing the looming government shutdown and saying \"we are going to cut a lot of people\" permanently if it occurs. FBI Director Kash Patel gave a contradictory account, stating agents were sent into crowd control after the riot was declared by Metro Police, while a Justice Department inspector general report in December found no evidence of undercover FBI officers at Capitol protests on January 6th.\n\n[Supreme Court meets to discuss Ghislaine Maxwell appeal and other pending cases](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-meets-discuss-ghislaine-maxwell-appeal-pending-cases-rcna233894). The Supreme Court justices meet Monday in private conference to discuss hundreds of appeals including Ghislaine Maxwell's challenge to her criminal convictions for recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell's lawyers argue that Epstein's nonprosecution agreement with Florida prosecutors should apply to one count in her case, raising the legal question of whether such agreements bind federal prosecutors nationwide or only in the district where negotiated. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell for hours this summer in a secretive encounter, after which she was moved from a low-security Florida prison to a minimum-security Texas camp, with the Justice Department later releasing full transcripts and audio of the interview.\n\n\n\n**International:**\n\n[Denmark bans drone flights after fresh drone sightings at military bases](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/denmark-bans-drone-flights-1.7645876). Denmark has ordered a ban on civilian drone flights from Monday through Friday after drones were observed at several military facilities overnight, following a week of incidents that forced temporary closures of multiple airports including Copenhagen. Denmark has called the drone activity part of a \"hybrid attack\" and Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has suggested Russia could be responsible, though the Kremlin denies involvement. The ban coincides with Denmark hosting EU leaders for a summit, with enhanced security measures including a German air defence frigate arriving to assist with airspace surveillance.\n\n[Moldova's pro-EU party wins election after campaign with Russian interference alleged](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/moldova-parliamentary-election-1.7646093). Moldova's ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity won a decisive victory with 50.2% of the vote against the Russian-leaning Patriotic Electoral Bloc's 24.2%, despite pre-election polls predicting a tight race. The result strengthens Moldova's bid to join the European Union by 2030, with European leaders congratulating the country for conducting the election despite what they called unprecedented Russian interference through vote-buying and disinformation. Russia denied meddling but accused Moldova of preventing hundreds of thousands of Moldovans living in Russia from voting, while opposition figures called for protests claiming electoral violations.\n\n[At least 12 dead in Vietnam from Typhoon Bualoi](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vietnam-typhoon-bualoi-aftermath-1.7646098). Typhoon Bualoi killed at least 12 people in central Vietnam before weakening to a tropical storm and moving into Laos, with rescue teams searching for 17 missing fishermen. The storm made landfall around midnight Sunday with winds up to 133 km/h, flooding roads, damaging homes and schools, and leaving more than 347,000 households without power. Bualoi had already caused at least 20 deaths in the Philippines since Friday, and was the second major storm to threaten Asia in a week following Typhoon Ragasa, which killed dozens across the region.\n\n[Russia pounds Kyiv, other regions in mass drone and missile attack](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/russia-mass-drone-missile-attacks-kyiv-1.7645803). Russia launched one of its most sustained attacks on Ukraine since the war began, firing 595 drones and 48 missiles at Kyiv and other regions, killing at least four people including a 12-year-old girl and injuring 67 others. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 568 drones and 43 missiles during the 12-hour assault that damaged a cardiology clinic, factories, and residential buildings. President Zelenskyy again urged the international community to impose sanctions on Russia's energy revenues and requested more air defense systems, noting that an additional Patriot system from Israel had been deployed with two more expected in autumn.\n\n[Palestinian death toll tops 66,000 as Israel's Netanyahu prepares to meet with Trump in the U.S.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/palestinian-death-toll-tops-66-thousand-1.7645848) Gaza's Health Ministry reported that over 66,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war, with 168,162 wounded, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. Trump is expected to present a 21-point ceasefire proposal that includes release of all hostages within 48 hours and gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces, though the plan is not finalized. Netanyahu faces mounting international pressure to end the war, with key Western allies recognizing a Palestinian state and the EU considering sanctions, while Israel insists it must \"finish the job\" against Hamas despite the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza.","ts":"2025-09-29T12:53:55Z","lang":"","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CANUSHelp/comments/1nth8jb/critical_news_committee_september_29_2025/","keywords":[],"source":"reddit-json"}

As you can imagine, we are not meeting goals to reduce our consumption; indeed, “**Countries are now collectively planning even more fossil fuel production than two years ago**, with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC by more than 120%.” [BP also predicts](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/25/bp-oil-and-gas-clean-energy-ukraine-middle-east-tariffs) a **slowdown to the green transition** and a future with higher oil &amp; gas consumption—which is probably easy for them to predict when they are shaping it.\n\n&gt;“**17 of the 20 profiled countries still plan to increase production of at least one fossil fuel to 2030**….Indonesia has set a target of increasing domestic gas production by 60% between 2023 and 2030….Brazil plans a 110% increase in gas production between 2023 and 2030….Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil and gas company, **Saudi Aramco, is now targeting 2030 production levels equivalent to a 53% increase over 2023**….The {U.S.} government has also announced its intention to boost coal-fired power production by delaying planned plant closures and reconsidering multiple environmental regulations….the Russian government is encouraging companies to develop new reserves through enhanced recovery from mature fields, exploit “hard-to-recover” reserves, and pursue Arctic exploration….The Ministry of Coal projects **coal demand in India to rise** from 998 Mt/yr in 2024 to 1462 Mt/yr by 2030 (a 46% increase) and 1755 Mt/yr by 2047 (a 76% increase from 2024)....” -selections from the 2025 Production Gap Report\n\n[Records were broken](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1969733315184730260) for a number of German places’ warmest September night, alongside all-time minimums in eastern Europe.

Urbanization, which increases food waste per capita, is expected to reduce the small waste disparity between countries. The scientists also state that the **overabundance of calories available to humans drives food waste**, and that managing food waste is important to long-term food security because it ultimately comes down to energy availability. “Supermarkets also encourage bulk buying and over-purchasing, which can lead to spoilage when planning is poor—particularly in urban areas.”\n\n[New research](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0331211) into pharmaceutical pollution in a number of EU states indicates that many wastewater treatment plants fail to adequately clean traces of various drugs out of the people’s drinking water—sourced in large part from surface water sources. \n\nChina is reportedly [cracking down on **negative online content**](https://archive.ph/vVCPV), and not just negative stuff about their government.

Pre-orders for the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max Synthesis and Veil started shipping earlier this week. Starting today, pre-orders for the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max Sheath will begin shipping. We expect pre-orders for the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max Paragon to start shipping next week. \n\nFor the latest updates, check the [*iPhone 17 preorders status page in our self-service portal.*](https://caudabe.customerdesk.io/#rp-customer-widget-faq-656e64bc-fe36-45c3-9421-4b79cd88e6bb) We'll be posting the latest updates over there. \n\nThis iPhone launch has completely eclipsed our expectations and is easily the biggest in our 13-year history. All of the teams in our four warehouses worldwide are working as fast as they can to process the huge volume of orders.\n\n⚠️ **Regions to which our Asia warehouse ships will generally receive orders the fastest. If you're in the US, UK, or Canada, don't be alarmed if your order hasn't yet shipped and you see others getting their shipping notifications. We receive the majority of our orders from the US, UK, and Canada, so our warehouses in these locations will need a bit more time to work through all of the orders.** \n\nAlso, Super Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm on record this year, passed through Asia earlier this week and impacted part of our operations and our carriers’ operations. That has delayed some shipments headed to our US, UK, and Canada warehouses by a few days.\n\n**A few colors originally slated for late September are now expected to ship around the second week of October:**\n\n* Sheath for 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max: Eucalyptus and Gray\n* Paragon for 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max: Ember\n\nIf you ordered one of these colors and would like to exchange for a color or product that will ship sooner, please [*contact our support team through the self-service portal.*](https://caudabe.customerdesk.io/#rp-customer-widget-home) They’ll be happy to help.\n\n**What do “Early,” “Mid,” and “Late” mean for pre-order dates?**\n\nOn our product pages for pre-order items, we list estimated dates based on when we expect to ship a particular product. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n* **Early:** 1st through 15th\n* **Mid:** 16th through 25th\n* **Late:** 26th through the end of the month\n\nThese are estimates and may shift slightly. The dates shown on our product pages are always based on orders placed today, while your specific order’s estimate **is in your order confirmation email.**\n\nAgain, to stay up to date, check the [*iPhone 17 pre-orders status page in our self-service portal.*](https://caudabe.customerdesk.io/#rp-customer-widget-faq-656e64bc-fe36-45c3-9421-4b79cd88e6bb) We appreciate everyone’s patience and can’t wait for you to get your new cases.","ts":"2025-09-26T14:09:06Z","lang":"","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Caudabe/comments/1nr2cbl/iphone_17_preorder_shipping_update/","keywords":[],"source":"reddit-json"}

Within minutes, several roads in major areas were submerged, vehicles barely moving, and people trapped everywhere, including in underpasses. The incessant downpour turned roads into rivers, washing away cars and bicycles. Low-lying areas of the city were the hardest hit. The downpour caused several sewer systems in the city to overflow, flooding nearby areas. Reservoirs on the outskirts of the city exacerbated the situation.  \nBanjara Colony in Hayathnagar was inundated with knee-deep water, destroying household belongings and keeping residents awake all night.

The region remains at risk of flooding, landslides, and three-meter tidal waves.\n\nAccording to official reports, at least three people have died, six are missing, and dozens were injured.\n\nEvacuations have been ordered for more than 9,000 residents in northern provinces, primarily Cagayan and Apayao.

Within minutes, several roads in major areas were submerged, vehicles barely moving, and people trapped everywhere, including in underpasses. The incessant downpour turned roads into rivers, washing away cars and bicycles. Low-lying areas of the city were the hardest hit. The downpour caused several sewer systems in the city to overflow, flooding nearby areas. Reservoirs on the outskirts of the city exacerbated the situation.  \nBanjara Colony in Hayathnagar was inundated with knee-deep water, destroying household belongings and keeping residents awake all night.

(17:00 local time, 10:00 BST)\n\nIt caused particular destruction in eastern Taiwan after a barrier lake burst in Hualien county on Tuesday, killing 17 people, with a further 17 still missing and 32 injured.\n\nTravel disruptions, school suspensions and mass evacuations were issued across Hong Kong and China’s Guangdong province, causing chaos across the regions.\n\nTyphoon Ragasa has slowly weakened over the hours since it made landfall, but conditions remain highly dangerous. It crossed the mainland coast near Yangjiang city with sustained winds of 144km/h (89 mph), BBC Weather’s Sarah Keith-Lucas reports.","ts":"2025-09-25T08:46:36Z","lang":"","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/RepWatchForum/comments/1nq1jpa/king_of_storms_typhoon_ragasa_makes_landfall_in/","keywords":[],"source":"reddit-json"}

The storm caused widespread damage, including fallen trees and neighborhood flooding.\n\n# The Spin\n\n# Climate-concerned narrative\n\nExtreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Global ocean temperatures have reached record levels for eight consecutive years, supplying the energy that fuels these devastating storms. The rapid intensification of Typhoon Ragasa, which occurred through an eyewall replacement cycle, demonstrates how quickly modern typhoons can strengthen in a warming world.\n\n# Climate-skeptic narrative\n\nThe frequent attempts to link cyclones to climate change often come across as overt climate alarmism. There are many contradictory studies examining factors such as sea surface temperatures and storm intensification, so skepticism is warranted whenever a powerful typhoon or hurricane is directly associated with global warming. Media outlets need to recognize the complexities of scientific research.","ts":"2025-09-24T23:42:38Z","lang":"","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AggressiveEarth2422/comments/1nprpw6/typhoon_ragasa_kills_17_in_taiwan/","keywords":[],"source":"reddit-json"}
